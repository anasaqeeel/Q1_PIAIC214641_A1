// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var list = ["porche", "teslax", "GT-R", "toyota supra"];
for (var _i = 0, list_1 = list; _i < list_1.length; _i++) {
    var var1 = list_1[_i];
    console.log("i would like own a ".concat(var1, " "));
}
