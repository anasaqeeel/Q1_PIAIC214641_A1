// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let list:string[]=["porche","teslax","GT-R","toyota supra"];
for(let var1 of list){
console.log(`i would like own a ${var1} `)
}
