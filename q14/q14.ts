// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


const guestList: string[] = ["Albert Einstein", "Weekend", "Denzel Washington"];

    console.log(`Dear ${guestList[0]},`);
    console.log("You are cordially invited to dinner at my place on Saturday.");
    console.log(`Dear ${guestList[1]},`);
    console.log("You are not invited to dinner at my place on Saturday.");
    console.log(`Dear ${guestList[2]},`);
    console.log("You are cordially invited to dinner at my place on Saturday.");
